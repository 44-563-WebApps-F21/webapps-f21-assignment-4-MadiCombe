    <p>[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]

        LADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come
        up and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes
        letter_.]
        
        LADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
        you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.
        
        GERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show
        myself worthy of it.
        
        LADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.
        
        GERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss
        Worsley.
        
        HESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?
        
        GERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out
        of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.
        
        HESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.
        
        LADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
        Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that
        may not be true.</p>
